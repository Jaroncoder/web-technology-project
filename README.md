# 🎶 Musician Image Map - Lab Exercise

This is a simple HTML project created as a **lab exercise** to understand how to map clickable areas on an image using `<map>` and `<area>` tags in HTML.

---

## 📌 Objective

To demonstrate how to:
- Use image mapping in HTML (`<map>` and `<area>`)
- Define multiple clickable shapes: `rect`, `circle`, and `poly`
- Trigger popup boxes using simple JavaScript
- Deploy a basic HTML site on GitHub Pages

---

## 🖼️ Project Overview

The web page shows an image of a music setup containing:
- 🎹 Keyboard
- 🎤 Microphone
- 🎸 Guitar

Each instrument is **mapped with a shape**:
- `rect` → Keyboard  
- `circle` → Microphone  
- `poly` → Guitar  

Clicking on each mapped area shows a **popup box** with more info about that instrument.
